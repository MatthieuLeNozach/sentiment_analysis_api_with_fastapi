"""
Module: models.py

This module defines the database models for the application using SQLAlchemy ORM.
It includes the following models:

1. User:
   - Represents a user in the system.
   - Attributes:
     - id: The primary key of the user.
     - username: The unique username of the user.
     - first_name: The first name of the user.
     - last_name: The last name of the user.
     - country: The country of the user (optional).
     - hashed_password: The hashed password of the user.
     - is_active: Indicates whether the user is active.
     - role: The role of the user.
     - has_access_sentiment: Indicates whether the user has access to BERT sentiment analyzer model.
     - has_access_emotion: Indicates whether the user has access to version RoBERTa emotion analyzer model.
   - Relationships:
     - service_calls: The service calls associated with the user.

2. ServiceCall:
   - Represents a service call made by a user.
   - Attributes:
     - id: The primary key of the service call.
     - service_version: The version of the service called.
     - success: Indicates whether the service call was successful.
     - owner_id: The foreign key referencing the user who made the service call.
     - request_time: The timestamp of when the service call was requested.
     - completion_time: The timestamp of when the service call was completed.
     - duration: The duration of the service call.
   - Relationships:
     - user: The user who made the service call.

The models are defined using SQLAlchemy's declarative base class `Base` from the
`database` module. They use the `Mapped` and `mapped_column` constructs from
SQLAlchemy 2.0 for defining the model attributes and relationships.

The `User` model has a one-to-many relationship with the `ServiceCall` model,
where each user can have multiple service calls associated with them.

Note: Make sure to run the necessary database migrations or create the corresponding
tables in the database based on these model definitions.
